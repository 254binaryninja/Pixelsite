# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
//

So this site is for  a marketing company which is mostly going to deal with web traffic and 
also it helps the owner know more about their market strategies , since after finishing with the frontend work they would like me to implement a scrolltrigger which brings a popup requesting email and where they heard of the site.

Hence the owner would also like an admin login where they can see the collective data collected so as to know where to put more marketing effort.
